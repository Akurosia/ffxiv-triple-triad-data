# XIVData

This is a collection of CSV and image files used for updating my Final Fantasy XIV web applications. The data is generated using [Saint Coinach](https://github.com/ufx/SaintCoinach).

### Generating the latest data

1. Download the latest version of SaintCoinach.Cmd from the project's [releases page](https://github.com/ufx/SaintCoinach/releases)
2. Unzip the archive and navigate into it
3. Copy `extract.bat` from this repository into the Saint Coinach folder
4. Edit the paths in the script as necessary
5. Run the script and check the changes into GitHub (Note: Windows has a serious fear of bats)
